      <p>
        Build a chain of words starting from 'a'. Each new word must be one
        letter different from a word already in your graph — by{" "}
        <b>adding</b>, <b>removing</b>, or <b>changing</b> a single letter.
      </p>

      <AnimatedExplainer />

      <h3>Daily</h3>
      <p>
        A fresh target word every day. Reach it from 'a' in as few moves as
        you can — when you solve it, you'll see your path and the optimal one.
      </p>

      <h3>Free play</h3>
      <p>
        Open-ended exploration. A new target appears at your chosen difficulty.
        Reach it to score points (the harder the difficulty, the more points)
        and a new target is picked.
      </p>

      <h3>Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Click any word in your graph to select it — your next word will branch from there.</li>
        <li>Scroll to zoom; double-click to recentre.</li>
        <li>Your progress is saved in your browser. Use Reset to start over.</li>
      </ul>
